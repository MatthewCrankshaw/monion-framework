## Resources

The `res` folder is used to store various resources that the application might need. These resources include SSL pem files, ECDSA pem files, and any other files that are required for the proper functioning of the application. The SSL and ECDSA files are automatically generated by a script in the scripts folder and inserted into this folder.

Please ensure that you place the necessary resources in this folder to ensure the smooth operation of the application.
